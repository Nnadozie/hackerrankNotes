# Updated Curriculum

Duration extended to 155 days, with first job hunting sprint tentatively beginning in May.

If you forget why you're doing this, just remember you're putting in place a foundation strong enough to support your career ambitions. You have alternatives. You can cut your learning short and cash out. In this case you will only be delaying the needful for career progression. You can take a university degree that'll lead to a job (but any skilled professional knows degrees are useless for the skills you want/need). Now, when you're obligation free and have saved up to secure your free time, is the best time to do this. It will be painful, but it will be worth it.

I will be

- Rehashing my foundations in Algorithms and Data structures, Java, Typescript, Databases and SQL. #Practisebased
- Informing myself about but not implementing core concepts like event driven architecture, modular service design, transforming monoliths to microservices, concurrent programming, and a few more. #Coursebased
- Rounding up the parts of #freeCodeCamp curriculum I haven't covered. #Projectsbased
- Upping my standards in accessibility, documentation and testing. #Coursebased
- Advancing my front-end game with advanced challenges in functional React using TypeScript, CSS architecture, CSS animations, Green Sock. #Projectbased
- Learning about but not necessarily implementing security standards, such as PCI DSS, and concepts involved in Cisco's CyberOps associate certification. #Coursebased
- Moving from beginner to high-intermediate in Back-end development using the Java ecosystem of technologies. #Projectbased
