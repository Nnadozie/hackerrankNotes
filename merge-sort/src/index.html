    Where nums is an array of intergers

mergeSort(nums) 
		items in nums ≤ 1?  return nums
		else,
		a = mergeSort(one-half of nums) 
		b = mergeSort(the other half of nums)

		execute merge routine:
			loop through each slot in nums
				if current elem of a, starting from the first one is less than current elem of b
						store it in nums current slot
						if you then run out of elems in a
							copy over the remaining elems of b into nums //it is done
						in the next loop check the next element in a, against the same one in b						
				
				else if current elem of b ≤ current elem of a
						store it in nums current slot
						if you then run out of elems in b
							copy over the remaining elems of a into nums //it is done
						in the next loop check the next element in b, against the same one in a

Important thing to note is that the first element of a sorted half
is the smallest integer. So comparing the first element in each half of the
arrays returned from the two recursive call, you are guaranteed to find the
smallest overall.
